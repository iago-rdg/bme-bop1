// Write a program that contains an array of 10 elements initialized by values of your choice.

// Shift all elements in the array towards the beginning of the array by one cell.
// The first element should go into the last cell (you may call this process rotation ). 
// Repeat the shifting (rotation) process 10 times, printing the array after each step. 
// Your output should be similar to the one shown on the right side.

// Keep in mind, that the task is not to obtain the output by using tricky indexing!
// The elements of the array must actually move around!

// LOOP
//     print the array        only printf here, no change in the array
//     rotate the array to the left by 1 the array changes, no printf here
// END OF LOOP

// Hint
// There is no need for a second array! The second element can overwrite the first, the third can overwite the secondâ€¦ 
// The only qestion is what shall we put into the last cell. Make a drawing and find out the necessary steps.
