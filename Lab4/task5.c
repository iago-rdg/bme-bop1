// An automatic speed control unit on a highway delivers data of the speeding
// cars only for several days in the following format: „hours minutes speed”.
// For example 12 45 198 means that at 12:45 some car passed by at a speed of 198 km/h.
// Data is terminated by 0 0 0.

// Write a C program that reads the data (several hours-minutes-speed triplets, until the terminating 0-0-0 triplet)
// and prints a table with the fastest speeding car in every hour!
// If there was no car violating the speed limit in a given hour, exclude that interval from the output.
//  The output should be like:

// 14:00-14:59 -> 145 km/h
// 16:00-16:59 -> 167 km/h
// (Hint: all speed values are positive.)
